  <a href="https://scor-int.org/group/174/">SPASS</a>
  (Small Plastics in the Ocean’s Interior: coherent Analysis and Synthesis for better Scrutiny)
  is established under the Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research
  <a href="https://scor-int.org/">(SCOR)</a>
  as the Working Group 174. SPASS tries to address critical gaps in understanding small plastics
  in the ocean interior by harmonizing methods for sampling, measurement, and data reporting
  of small plastics across the water column. The working group will develop better-practice
  standards, validate existing datasets, promote open data sharing, and strengthen international
  and regional research capacity to improve estimates of plastic sources, transport, and impacts.
