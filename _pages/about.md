[SPASS] (https://scor-int.org/group/174/) (Small Plastics in the Ocean’s Interior: coherent Analysis and Synthesis for better Scrutiny) is established under the Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research (SCOR) as the Working Group 174. SPASS tries to address critical gaps in understanding small plastics in the ocean interior by harmonizing methods for sampling, measurement, and data reporting of small plastics across the water column. The working group will develop better-practice standards, validate existing datasets, promote open data sharing, and strengthen international and regional research capacity to improve estimates of plastic sources, transport, and impacts.

#If you're interested in collaborating, please feel free to get in touch. For those outside Japan, Japan offers both short-term and long-#term programs to support international students, as well as early-career and senior scientists. I encourage you to explore opportunities, #such as the [Sakura Science Exchange Program](https://ssp.jst.go.jp/en/) and the [JSPS Fellowships](https://www.jsps.go.jp/english/e-#inv/index.html).
