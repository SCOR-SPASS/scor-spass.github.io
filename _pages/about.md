    <a href="https://scor-int.org/group/174/">SPASS</a>
    (Small Plastics in the Ocean’s Interior: coherent Analysis and Synthesis for better Scrutiny)
    is established under the Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research
    <a href="https://scor-int.org/">(SCOR)</a>
    as the Working Group 174. SPASS tries to address critical gaps in understanding
    small plastics in the ocean interior by harmonizing methods for sampling,
    measurement, and data reporting of small plastics across the water column.
    The working group will develop better-practice standards, validate existing
    datasets, promote open data sharing, and strengthen international and regional
    research capacity to improve estimates of plastic sources, transport, and impacts.
